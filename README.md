This repository demonstrates an uncommon type mismatch error in TypeScript. The `add` function is defined to accept two numbers and return a number. However, the code attempts to call the function with a string and a number.  This showcases a situation where TypeScript's type system might not catch an error, leading to runtime exceptions.  The solution provides a refined type checking mechanism.
